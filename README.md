# Computers and Robots Club Coding Labs
## Maze Code Lab
#### Instructions
1. Download and unzip this folder (the green button is for dowloading the code)
2. Open the file "myMazeAlgorithm.py" using the Python IDLE/IDE that you downloaded
3. Listen to your breakout group leader and follow along with their instructions on how to code the maze algorithm
#### Key
* "*" is a wall
* "S" is the start
* "E" is the end
* "<" is the robot pointing to the right
* ">" is the robot pointing to the left
* "v" is the robot pointing down
* "^" is the robot pointing up
#### Methods
* **canMoveForward()**: checks if the robot can move forward
* **moveForward()**: moves the robot forward one step
* **turnLeft()**: makes the robot turn left
* **turnRight()**: makes the robot turn right
* **isDone()**: checks if the robot is done navigating the maze
* **willReachEnd()**: checks if a single step forward will make the robot reach the end
* **printMaze()**: prints the current state of the maze with the location and direction of the robot
